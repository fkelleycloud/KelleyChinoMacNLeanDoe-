### ~~~~KelleyChinoMacNLeanDoe-

More Gossip, from an actor, who imagines her name imprinted into the first wallet address, and eats hamburgers, while rockin a slug as a mustache, since this transgendered lazy woman has nothing better to do.


Being connected does not make you a hoe,
after being raped, as i mentioned in my in the Blockchain algorithm (as my secret) since i felt awful ever telling anyone, i wrote in MY FAKE work as some say since I needed to say it or feel I was telling someone. After the rape, from those 5 men, I struggled to leave my home, I was very young and at 17 years old I meet the man who fathered our three kids, my bf bring to my house, she met him upon my family begging me to go to my first loves birthday party. My bf had left from the party and ending up leaving her phone in his car. 

he took the phone back to her and they came over to my house unannounced, we met and been together since, nd had 3 kids, 

we went through many issues , yet the hoe is from the hotel he went in to and left me pregnant and our son outside in his car.

i never got a chance to drive, we never cared to support me with this yet i finished my drivers ed at 17, 

i graduated from Highschool and a Medical Assistant program, but never earned my degree. 

my works means the world to me, and sadly 
after my efforts of struggle to build a network from nothing i was destoryed, and worst came across this after further investigation of my data, im sad cause i have been through enough, and its unfair no matter how hard i try it never really matters as im only the joke, 

my taxes were even ruined, cant access none my emails, my domain, uet i do still adapt with i am good at and continue the solving the issues i often see, 

i acknowledged others for there work and apologize if i used your script in a game and did not cite you please tell me ill fix it.

to build up from nothing and own a network with over trillions, and yet to have a penny in your pocket, and only be used for temporary surrogacy as they say, 
is the worst feeling, on top of all the gossip i see and read here online

dont hurt others.
please

i am hurt and wish i could afford a lawyer, i try to br audited for the work and yet, they destory all items constantly, 

my accounts, etc

even worst i know it is you Chino

your the only one around me and that has been around me 
who drives me everywhere work and home, school and home, store and home, kids appointments and home, 

yet you paid that hoe in the hotel while you just got me pregnant with our third child

not to mention she has kids herself yet i didnt see them come along as you both exited the room together and jumped into the car together as we gave the real hoe

a ride to that house with those five people just sitting outside


you have no idea how much time i spent reading on the information,

since it was pre layouted for you 
to simply take over and when i constantly asked you why your number was a 2 step on my account you denied.

your not apart of me no longer 

you wanted it so bad and failed to care 
for the person who stood by you for over 16 years, 
were 36 and 34 

thats half my life living together you and
i
and still til this day anyone is perfect and im the problem,
that actual hoe, yet my work now labeled hoe
your ex you dated only a year when you were 13.

over me and you since 17 and 19
til 34 and 36

what hurts the most is you even called me a liar,

i will stop at nothing til the world is soon calling you a hoe and your hoes hoes.

as sadly i will always have respect for others especially the ones ive known most of my life, even when you shouldn't have it, i still give

and refuse the names

the world is welcome to ask questions ill answer.

thankyou to who reads this![Screenshot_20231017-192128](https://github.com/fkelleycloud/KelleyChinoMacNLeanDoe-/assets/147815878/fe8ba233-9383-4ad1-9e71-dcb607c96d13)
